# NLP_Python_Blockchain
A system utilizes Named Entity Recognition and Question Answering system to derive answers for NGO with Python and Blockchain.

The Project investigates the combination of Machine Learning (ML), particularly the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) framework, with blockchain technology to improve the functions and strategic development of Non-governmental Organisations (NGO’s). The study analyses how sophisticated technologies like Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Question-Answering (QA) techniques can enhance NGO’s data analysis and financial clarity and operational effectiveness. 

The research underscores the major obstacles encountered by non-governmental organisations, such as governance challenges and financial viability, while stressing the need for creative solutions in a data-driven setting. By employing an extensive Named Entity Recognition (NER) pipeline utilizing the BERT large model, the study showcases enhancements in information management and decision-making abilities within NGO’s.  Result indicate that NER surpasses Roberta models in terms of processing speed and resource utilisations, rendering it a better option for certain NGO purposes. Moreover, incorporating QA techniques along with blockchain technology improves data integrity traceability and accountability.  

This study emphasizes the significance the implementing these technologies in a versatile and uncomplicated way while pinpointing opportunities for further research, such as evaluating cost-effectiveness and ensuring data integrity. In conclusion, the dissertation showcases how NER, QA and blockchain could transform the efficiency and transparency of non-governmental Organisation.
